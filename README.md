This is a client for facebook messenger that allows users to log in and use messenger in an 'encrypted mode' (RSA 2048 encryption). 

It uses custom protocols for requesting and storing public keys to associate with friends who are also using this messenger encrypted client, and ofcourse protocols to encrypt and decrypt outgoing and incoming messages with friends.

**Risk of facebook account getting locked if used inapporiately (spam messages, frequent log in/out's, multiple sessions etc), reccomended to use alt accounts for safety OR enable 2FA on your fb account**
